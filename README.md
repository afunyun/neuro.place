# NEUROSAMA PLACE

Collaborative pixel placement app for the Neurosama community

## 9/21/25

- site noticed due to other pixel canvas being popular i suppose, so it's about that time to fix the pixel log

See [full changelog](./changelog.md) for the rest.

Website: [neurosama.place](https://neurosama.place)

## Features

- faster than you might expect on both front and backend
- real time updates for all connected
- live logging of placements location & colour & who placed it
- discord based authentication as well as additional, optional whitelist system
- live admin functions & status page reporting for all elements of the system 

We have set up a [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ba3H5Tjn) in case there are any questions, requests, whatever you may want to be there for.
The discord contains a webhook tracking pixel placements in real time, and also  a webhook for when a push is made to the main repo//build
is sent to the worker to update the site itself on cloudflare.
