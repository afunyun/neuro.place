# Development Scratchpad

## Session: 2025-07-05 - WebSocket Timeout & Backup System Cleanup

### Completed Work

#### WebSocket Timeout Implementation
- **Files Modified**: `src/index.js`, `public/static/js/script.js`
- **Primary Goal**: Implement timeout system in Durable Object to clean up idle WebSocket connections after 1 minute of inactivity
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `sessionActivity` Map to track last activity timestamp for each WebSocket connection
  - Implemented `timeoutCheckInterval` that runs every 30 seconds to check for idle connections
  - Added ping/pong heartbeat mechanism with client sending pings every 30 seconds
  - Server responds to pings and updates activity timestamp
  - Connections idle for >60 seconds are automatically closed with reason "Timeout due to inactivity"
- **Methods Added**:
  - `startTimeoutCheck()`: Starts the timeout monitoring interval
  - `stopTimeoutCheck()`: Stops the timeout monitoring interval  
  - `checkAndCloseIdleConnections()`: Checks for and closes idle connections
- **Client-Side Changes**:
  - Added `pingInterval` and `PING_INTERVAL = 30000` constants
  - Implemented `startPing()` and `stopPing()` functions
  - Modified WebSocket event handlers to manage ping mechanism

#### Connection Status UI Implementation
- **Files Modified**: `public/index.html`, `public/static/css/style.css`, `public/static/js/script.js`
- **Goal**: Add visual connection status indicator next to pixel log with hover tooltip
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added connection status span element: `<span id="connectionStatus" class="connection-status disconnected" title="Disconnected">!</span>`
  - Created comprehensive CSS styling for connection status indicator with hover effects
  - Status shows ✓ for connected, ! for disconnected
  - Hover expands to show status text
  - Smooth transitions and visual feedback
- **Functions Added**:
  - `updateConnectionStatus(isConnected)`: Updates status indicator and tooltip
  - `showReconnectModal()`: Displays modal when connection is lost
  - `hideReconnectModal()`: Hides reconnect modal
- **UI Enhancement**: Removed connection status messages from pixel log to avoid clutter

#### Automatic Backup System Removal
- **Files Modified**: `src/index.js`, `public/static/js/grid-tender.js`
- **Problem**: Deployments were triggering backup/restore functionality unnecessarily
- **Solution**: Removed automatic backup system while preserving manual backup/restore admin controls
- **Automatic Backup Components Removed**:
  - `lastBackupTime` property from Durable Object constructor
  - `backupInterval` timing mechanism
  - `pixelChangesSinceBackup` tracking
  - Automatic backup creation on pixel changes
  - Corruption detection and auto-restore functionality
- **Manual Backup Functionality Preserved**:
  - `GridBackup` class with all manual backup methods
  - Admin panel backup/restore controls
  - `/admin/grid/restore` endpoint for manual restoration
  - `createBackup()`, `downloadBackup()`, `restoreFromBackup()`, `uploadAndRestore()`, `clearGrid()` methods

### Issues Resolved

#### Major Misunderstanding Resolution
- **Initial Error**: Accidentally removed ALL backup functionality when user only wanted automatic backup removed
- **User Feedback**: "buddy don't remove the ENTIRE backup functionality lmfao, i guess i should've clarified. The AUTO backup needs to be removed."
- **Resolution**: Restored manual backup functionality (GridBackup class, admin controls) while keeping automatic system removed
- **Lesson**: Always clarify scope of removal requests - "remove backup functionality" vs "remove automatic backup functionality"

#### Backup Restore Issue
- **Problem**: Backup restore was only restoring recently changed pixels, not entire grid
- **Root Cause**: Related to automatic backup tracking system that was monitoring pixel changes
- **Resolution**: Removing automatic backup system resolved this issue
- **User Confirmation**: "Yeah I think the issue was just with the auto backup. KK that's fine then"

### Technical Implementation Notes

#### WebSocket Timeout System Architecture
- Uses Map-based activity tracking rather than per-connection properties
- Timeout check runs independently of connection events
- Graceful connection closure with descriptive reason
- Client-side ping mechanism ensures active connections stay alive
- 30-second client ping interval with 60-second server timeout provides appropriate buffer

#### Connection Status UI Design
- Minimal visual footprint - just ✓/! indicator
- Hover expansion for detailed status text
- CSS transitions for smooth user experience
- Integrated with existing pixel log layout
- No interference with pixel log functionality

#### Backup System Separation
- Clean separation between automatic and manual backup systems
- Manual backup system remains fully functional for admin operations
- Automatic system completely removed to prevent deployment triggers
- Grid now relies on normal Durable Object storage without backup interference

### Current Status
- All requested functionality implemented and working
- User confirmed issue resolution
- No pending tasks or follow-up work required
- System ready for production use

### Next Steps
- Monitor WebSocket timeout system in production
- Watch for any issues with manual backup/restore functionality
- Consider implementing grid storage optimization as mentioned in issue_progress.md
